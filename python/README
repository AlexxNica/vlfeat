DESCRIPTION
  C++ python wrappers of a subset of VLFeat (http://www.vlfeat.org). Includes the following 
  functions:
   - kmean: vl_ikmeans, vl_ikmeanspush, vl_hikmeans, vl_hikmeanspush
   - mser: vl_mser, vl_erfill
   - sift: vl_sift, vl_dsift, vl_siftdescriptor
   - imop: vl_imsmooth
   - misc: vl_binsum
   
COMPILING
  The following instructions are specific for Ubuntu but it should be similar on 
  other LINUX distributions and probably on MAC OS.
  The c++ wrappers need boost python to be installed
  > sudo apt-get install boost-python1.35-dev
  > cd vlfeat && make
  This should generate a dynamic library file _vlfeat.so in the directory vlfeat/ 

TESTING
  To run the python tests, you need to have numpy, pylab and PIL installed:
  > sudo apt-get install python-numpy
  > sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
  > sudo apt-get install python-imaging

  Then, you need to set the system variable to where is README is located:
  > export PYTHONPATH="path to this README"

  Once these two steps done, you should be able to run the test:
  > cd vlfeat/demo
  > python2.5 vl_demo_sift_basic.py
  > python2.5 vl_demo_sift_edge.py
  > python2.5 vl_demo_sift_peak.py
  > python2.5 vl_demo_sift_or.py
  (make sure you have the image a.pgm in vlfeat/data dir)
