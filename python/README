		       Mikael Rousson (mikael@polarrose.com)

DESCRIPTION
  - wrappers: c++ python wrappers of vl_erfill, vl_mser and vl_sift
  - vlfeat: python code for test and display
   
COMPILING
  The following instructions are specific for Ubuntu but it should be similar on 
  other LINUX distributions and probably on MAC OS.
  The c++ wrappers need boost python to be installed
  > sudo apt-get install boost-python1.35-dev
  > cd wrappers && make install 
  
TESTING
  To run the python tests, you need to have numpy, pylab and PIL installed:
  > sudo apt-get install python-numpy
  > sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
  > sudo apt-get install python-imaging
  Once these packages installed, you should be able to run the test:
  > cd vlfeat
  > python vlfeat.py
  (make sure you have the image box.pgm in vlfeat/data dir)
